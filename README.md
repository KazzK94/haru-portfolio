# Haru Portfolio
This is a portfolio to show the digital art of Haru Blue.

## View Transitions (WIP)
This is being worked on, but it will eventually be fully functional to transition from the list of images to a Detail view for each one.

For now, only the first image transitions correctly, since the Detail view is forced to correspond to the first image. This will be solved shortly.

### What I need to do first...
But first i need to: 
 1) Turn the raw images data into JSON formatted data to extract it to a file.
 2) Give each entry a specific key, which would be part of the url when visiting the detail.

And yeah that would be most of it. Hopefully this will be implemented soon.
